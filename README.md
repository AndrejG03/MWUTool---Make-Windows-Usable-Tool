## What it does - Security

- Harden the system to prevent Mimikatz credential scraping attack

- Disable SMB Server, it's known for opening doors for mass ransomware attacks - WannaCry and NotPetya
- Disable Anonymous enumeration of shares. Allowing anonymous logon users to list all account names and enumerate all shared resources can provide a map of potential points to attack the system (Stigviewer V-220930)
- Disable Wi-Fi Sense, it connects you to open hotspots that are "greenlighted" through crowdsourcing. Openning doors to Lure10 MITM attack and phishing (Stigviewer V-220808)
- Disable Remote Assistance (RA). RA may allow unauthorized parties access to the resources on the computer. (Stigviewer V-220823)
- Disable Autoplay, "allowing autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system" (Stigviewer V-63673)

Usage
============

1) Run Power Shell as admin;
2) Type the following to enable PowerShell script execution:
<code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force</code>

3) Confirm the question;

4) Run the script:
<code>%path-to-file%/wor.ps1</code>

or just right click the file wor.ps1 and select "Execute with powershell"

Notes
============

- To prevent Windows to install bloatware, this script must be run before connecting to the internet for the first time;
- Disabling Windows defender is unreversible and needs the system to be in safe mode;
- Some NICs may show the preferred DNS encryption as "Unencrypted Only" after running the the fingerprinting prevention. Thats not true, the DNS is being handled over HTTPS (DoH) and there will be no traffic on port 53. Test using::

<code>pktmon filter remove </code>

<code>pktmon filter add -p 53</code>

<code>start --etw -m real-time</code>
